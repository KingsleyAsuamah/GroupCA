Scenario:

Create an Information System for a selected domain of interest. 
You may use any back-end, including a DB developed in another module. 
You may use any front-end, including CLI, GUI, web and API.
Describe the requirements of the information system, including users, data requirements, search, sorting, entry, update, validation, integrity, reporting etc.
Implement and test the Information System, and document your implementation thoroughly.
You must use public git (e.g. GitHub) to manage your source and versioning, with regular frequent commits. Git may be used to verify engagement and contribution, and failure to engage may result in a zero grade.
You must attribute all code not written from scratch, either in accordance with its licence, if applicable, or if not, #taken from ...  failure to do so may result in a zero grade.
You may use any programming language, however example programs will be presented in Python.
